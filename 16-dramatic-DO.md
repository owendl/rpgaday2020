# Dramatic

I have already mentioned in a previous [post](06-forest-DO.md) that it easy to avoid some of the more actor-y aspects of roleplaying by hiding behind the dice. You have in your mind these great and fabulous monologues and soliloquies from other media. To make the game dramatic and epic you think you need to match those. It can feel intimidating to it coming to your turn and you don't have a cool idea or funny quip prepared. That spotlight can be bright enough to wilt a budding gamer seedling. 

I see it regularly with new folks (and at convention games). I understand the paralysis, everyone wants to be cool and entertaining at the table with the crazy great idea that puts everyone in histerics. When players are stuck trying to think of what they want to do I have some advice: be boring. Do whatever naturally follows from the thing that preceded it. 

Maybe this seems counterintuitive, but let me explain some of the advantages: 
1.  By building on the last thing that happened, you are builing on something another player did, strengthening the bonds of the characters and players.
3.  It is so much easier than trying to be "creative", so the table doesn't get bogged down
3.  Out of left-field ideas tend to introduce out of leftfield story elements, cluttering the main dramatic thrust of the scene. Doing what follows natuarally keeps the story more organic and flowing.

Those with a little bit of theatre background will recognize these as just variations on the classic improv storytelling training. And the reason is that a roleplaying *is improvised storytelling*, just with dice to decide certain story beats.

An excellent reference for concepts on this is _Play Unsafe_, by Graham Walmsley, available for purchase in various corners of the internet.
