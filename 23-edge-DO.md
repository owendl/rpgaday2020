# Edge

The most recent long-term game I played in was a Star Wars Edge of the Empire game. The system was an interesting experience for me. The game used custom dice (which considering my collection of Fate dice, I can't blame them) to decide success and failure, advantage and threat. Coming from the Fate world I can appreciate the partial success or succuess at a cost. The game also included Force points for introducing story elements.

My biggest gripe with the system is also probably it's greatest selling point, in that it is a little too simulationist for my tastes. If you give me an equipment list to buy gear, I will tend to tune it out. I have seen too many times that all that gear (and supplement books with new bits, looking at you 3rd Edition D&D) can tend to unbalance the core game. 

Our [GM](https://github.com/Jim89/rpgaday2020) would probably admit to it as well that the game became a little unbalanced at times (a couple of players had a bit of the True Gamer in them). I did my part to tilt the balance the other way, with a character that specialized in getting beat up and running away And offering up suggestions to Jim on how to screw us over (which he usually delighted in).
