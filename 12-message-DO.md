There is a tradition in roleplaying of passing secret messages to or fromt the Gamemaster, with the intention of plotting some secret machination that none of the other characters know or the Gamemaster revealing to the player something that no other character could know. 

The intention of the secrecy is noble, to avoid meta-gaming (for the unitiated in the fold that is playing the game like a game instead of playing the game as your character). It can prevent meta-gaming, but that assumes players are out to win the game and, with the exception of a few, roleplaying games don't have a winner. 

My philosophy on games is one that tries to balance what it true for my character but good for the story. I am not so attached to any particular character that I won't ever let them die. 

Maybe this is a philosophical thing. To quote Shepherd Book when was asked why he didn't care about the destination, "Because the journey is the worthier thing." I would rather play well and lose than cheat and win.

And secret messages do allow for dramatic reveals at opportune moments. And who doesn't love a surprise twist ending.
