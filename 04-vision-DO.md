# Vision

I find myself thinking about the future of the game, which is odd considering there isn't just one game. It seems like RPG fandom is more a collection of groups rather than a monolith but maybe that is true for everything when looking from the inside.

From the outside however it probably does look like a monolith and it is called Dungeons & Dragons. I don't know if they even have the greatest market share anymore but if you say Pathfinder to a random person on the street they will think you are referring to a SUV. 

I returned to D&D for the first time in almost 10 years. I had heard that new edition included more narrative gaming elements so I was curious how much it had changed.

It has not. 

That is not to say that it is bad, I have said for years that D&D is the missionary position of roleplaying games: it is everyone's first time and maybe it is vanilla but it gets you there everytime.

Sidebar: So technically it wasn't my first time. While I did buy an Advanced D&D book and create a character I never actually played with him. My first time playing was West End Games Star Wars. But it was someone else's D&D game that hooked me into the hobby so I still count it. Now back to the sex part:

With D&D's place as the flagship of the industry, I wonder what it represents for our game(s). It certainly looks more mainstream than ever. Critical Role is quite popular YouTube show and I can't count how many different actual play podcasts are out there. Hell, bars have D&D nights. Maybe a generation of nerds growing up with the internet made possible the holding on of these, admittedly childish, pursuits. 

But I can't help but comparing roleplaying games to board games. Board games seem more innovative (could we imagine a board game from the 1970s still being the dominant player in the scene). Maybe that is board games are by their nature so self-contained, with every game essentially being its own one-shot, the implied churn leading to more chaos and creativity.

Does that mean RPGs by their very nature hold themselves back? I don't have a clear vision for where our game is going. I worry a little that the mainstreaming of D&D will lead to just a bunch of people looking to punch that square on their geek bingo. But does its ubiquity mean that we have a better chance of capturing more peopel that grow a passion for roleplaying? I hope so. I want more people around the table ready jam in our own special way. Because when it is good there is nothing like it. 

Just like sex. (See, I said I would get back to the sex part)
