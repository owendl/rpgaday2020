# Frame

Man just check this shit out: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrmwood/modular-gaming-table

I go back and forth about gaming tables. I like the idea of a dedicated space with storage and accessories. But most of the roleplaying games I play don't really require anything more than a noteboard (another excellent gaming item for the GM on the go: https://thenoteboard.com/collections/products/products/noteboard).

But having a piece of furniture like this might go a long way to normalizing gaming. And it is so, so pretty. Maybe I can convince the wife to go for one of the littler options. For the kid's room? The kid is going to need a little table to do little kid things on? And the frame is adaptable so we could always scale up the the table size with the kid. Plus bonus storage! Totally a worthwhile investment. Right? Please. Pretty please.
