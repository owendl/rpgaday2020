# Comfort

My dad was in the US Air Force when I was growing up, meaning I moved every few years to a new school (high mark being middle school: three different schools in a three year period). So I have a certain degree of comfort walking into somewhere not knowing anyone and making quick acquaintances. So sitting down to a roleplaying game, playing pretend is pretty easy for me. 

It might be trivial to create comfort for games played amongst friends but we don't always have that option. Looking for group (LFG) posts litter online message boards. And of course con games are basically that non-stop.

Building the comfort at the table for a new group of players can be pretty tough though. I think setting the right table culture is the single most important thing a Gamemaster does. I am going to quote from John Stavropoulos' wonderful document on the [X-card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit)
```
Some play RPGs because, "RPGs are like video games except you can do anything limited by your imagination."
 
But that's not true, RPGs are a group activity, not a solo one. If the group isn't into randomly killing everything and anything, including murdering prostitutes, ala a more open version of Grand Theft Auto... it is going to be a socially dysfunctional experience.
```

I recommend everyone that thinks they might run games take a look at John's write up. He is a passionate player, Gamemaster and all-around fan of the hobby. We as those already in it need to make it open and accessible to newcomers and I think things like John's X-Card are wonderful tools for all of us.
