# Shade

The evil campaign is another trope of the hobby. As I understand it, the goal is to create a group of evil characters and then proceed to maraud across the world. 

Maybe I haven't felt a need to get back at the world but I haven't ever felt a need to indulge that particular fantasy. Even now, I don't even really understand it.

I understand that the #rpgaday prompts are meant to be positive but with a prompt like shade my thoughts tend to darken.
