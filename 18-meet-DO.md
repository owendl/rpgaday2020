# Meet

There is a quote from Gary Gygax, one of the inventors of roleplaying, where he said (paraphrasing) "I am proud to have invented a social game for inherently non-social people". Meeting people in real life is hard. Human society is a bundle of complex social cues and unspoken rules. Culture, custom, tradition, expectation. I think everyone frets about it in some way or another.

But some of us have a harder time than others. Maybe we were on the spectrum. Maybe we had a cloistered life. Maybe we were constantly moving and never had a friend for more than a few years at a time. 

I would count myself amongst those with a tricky time navigating social situations for most of my life. I still find myself overanalyzing and replaying social interactions trying to understand what I should have done or could do in the future. 

Now going back to that Gygax quote, roleplaying games provide a framework to mneet new people in a controlled and (somewhat) predictable manner. The game's rules provide structure and it's setting provides the tone. The social contract of the table is out in the open and easy for everyone to subscribe. 

A social game for non-social people. Oxymoron?
