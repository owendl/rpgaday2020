# Rest

A random digression into my favorite magic item in Dungeons and Dragons: I mentioned the [half-elf ranger](02-change-DO.md) that holds a special place in my heart. The class-conceit of that character was an obscure prestige class called the Bloodhound, essentially a tracking and bounty hunter approach to ranger-ing. Admittedly not a terribly important ability in most games but as we have established I wasn't necessarily building that character for maximum power efficiency.

Which comes to a favorite item of mine: the [ring of sustenance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/rings/ring-of-sustenance/). No need to carry rations or water and only needs to sleep 2 hours a night! Even though I don't think a DM has ever once asked me how many days of trail rations do you have or what are you going to do to eat during an adventure. For the most part it only ever meant that my character stood watch almost the entirety each night our party rested. According to the rules, character's were only allowed to wear two magic rings and I chose for one of mine a ring with almost no actual game effects.

But I loved the idea of Dryson being able to go all day and night with almost no rest trailing his prey. At one point he actually tracked some kind of horse drawn carriage across an entire continent without falling behind. (I will save you all of the details but it was really a combination of things that let him do so but the ring did help a lot). By doing this I kind of derailed some of the DM's plans (Sorry Ip). But a bloodhound never gives up.
