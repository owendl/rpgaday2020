# Close

Bringing a game to a close is a tricky thing. I find that I often know what I want the framing of the final scene to be but getting there in a timely manner can be tricky. Too fast and the story hasn't been fully fleshed out. Too slow and everyone feels like it is a slog. 

In some ways classic D&D is an easy game to close out, you just always end with a Big Fight. As the game progresses the Big Fight becomes bigger and bigger until you finish fighting a dragon or a slaad. And the overarching story is governed by the Big Heroic Quest.

If you have paid attention to my posts, you might have figured out that I don't play much D&D anymore. What's more, the games I do run tend towards episodic in nature, existing as a single session. Building the Big Heroic Quest is not something that comes naturally to me and when I have run long running games, I find myself bolting on the long-running story to the episodes. In a sense that might be good, letting the story evolve naturally but can lack the clean coherence of the Big Heroic Quest.

I mentioned [previously](26-strange-DO.md) my favorite game I have ever run. In my mind, even though I have not run the game in almost 5 years, it isn't over. I haven't finished it, brought the story to a close. I think part of the problem was towards the end I wasn't giving the game the time it required to prep.

The last year or so of the game several things conspired to make it harder to run the game. Graduate school started to seriously ramp up, as my 20's were coming to a close and that shit needed to end. I fell in love taking my mind into a new realm. 

I wasn't giving the game the attention it required and it felt like the sessions started to suffer and the players weren't quite as bought in. The game just sort of petered out, several players moving away and starting new chapters in their own lives. 

I still want to run one more game but because I want it to be special I keep putting it off. I want that last game to really sing, to capture the feel of those early games, to give every character a spotlight moment. I need to close it out right. Now if I can just find the time.
