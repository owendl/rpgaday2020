# Experience

I spoke about the most recent ongoing game I have played in. [recently](23-edge-DO.md). The game really brings me full circle. My first game was Star Wars so it was fun to go back to the beginning, learning a new game. In that first game I was mechanic/pilot, in this one I was the pilot/mechanic. In that first game our ship was The Grizzled Mongoose, in this it was The Rusty Dewback (don't care what you say Jim, it was a wonderful ship). I even brought back my Star Wars naming hack of just using a single letter, N, as a name (I find Star Wars names difficult to come up with). And our game included a couple of first time gamers and a first time GM. 

I kind of felt like the old hand at the table, the veteran sharing my experience. I got to see Jim's first experience with players completely derailing an adventure (he yes and-ed his way through it with flying colors). I got to see some of the players geek out on working the systems to become the ultimate weapons. And one guy who seemed to specialize in just making terrible choices and sowing chaos. It took me back to my roots. And reminded me why I love the game.
