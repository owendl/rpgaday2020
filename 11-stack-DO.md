# Stack

Roleplaying games are such a beautifully analog hobby. The smell of manuals, the clacking of the dice, the smudges on the paper, the novelty of the accessories. 

These physical objects provide a wonderful way to walk down memory lane. I like to hold onto character sheets, I have a stack of them in a couple of folders with all of my other roleplaying materials.

Lets take a walk down memory lane...

Here is Jimmy O'Connor, from Paul's pick-up Call of Cthullu game. For a game that is all about characters dying or going insane he lasted a really long time. He went from a green hero-cop to a homical psychopath with a Cthullu Mythos of 48! And he still isn't dead!

Here is the exclamation point that John would hang on his GM screen to remind us that player death was a possibility. I remember the chat we had prior to the first game at the Krystal on Northside Drive, where he impressed upon me that he really needed me to roleplay my nobleman assembling of the party for the initial quest.

Here is the pocket notebook of game notes I used to simulate the photographic memory of my rennaissance era spy. If you played in that game, then the note about 3/4 of the way down is kind of a BOOM moment. I still want to go back to Veritas.

This was a character sheet from a one-shot at GenCon 2014. The game is based on a podcast/stage show The Thrilling Adventure Hour. (Sidebar: You should listen to it. Get on the patreon to access the back catalog. You will thank me.) The players were all super fans, including the designer that ran the session. The game has never been released so I consider this kind of collector's item (even though I know it isn't).

...the walk could go on but it could take a while. Suffice to say the stack will continue to grow, a physical repository of memories of joyful games.
