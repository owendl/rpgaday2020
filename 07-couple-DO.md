# Couple

My relationship with gaming has often included another person. Someone that I find myself chatting with about characters, systems and, most crucially of all, scheduling. 

My first RPG "boyfriend" was the [previously](01-beginning-DO.md) [mentioned](02-change-DO.md) Dooley. He grew up in a gamer household, his uncle being seriously in the hobby. He was probably the infection vector for everyone else in our group. He was a pretty quiet fellow, member of Opus One and part of the International Baccalaureate program. Being in most of the same classes together we would often trade comics and RPG manuals (I really tried to sell our group on d20 Modern but no one was really biting). 

My memories are of him, hunched over a piece of graph paper drawing out a dungeon, square gridded the whole way or making characters during school. We rolled d6's at the lunchroom table or, when we didn't have our dice, ripping a corner of a piece of paper into 6 even pieces, writing the numbers on it and drawing from them for the stats (let's be honest, I loved making characters too). One of the quirkies characters I remember him making was a goblin ranger that utilized a net. Why he felt an affinity for the little monster I didn't understand but darned if he didn't one-man a room of animated statues by himself after the rest of us dropped in the second round. I recall he used the net, tanglefoot bags (who buys those, Dooley does) and judicious use of his move action to keep the statues from ganging up on him as he slowly took the last three on by himself, plink by plink.

Dooley and I drifted apart in college, he went to UF and me to Georgia Tech. You never really forget your first though.
