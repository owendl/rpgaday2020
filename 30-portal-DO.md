Sometimes I feel like a bad gamer because I don't really ever buy games at a gaming shop. For several years now I have only ever bought pdf's of roleplaying manuals (with the exception of an occasional [keepsake](27-favor-DO.md)). Roleplaying games are a tricky thing to get into, they seemingly require someone to [teach](01-beginning-DO.md) them to you. Shops offer a physical starting point for a place for someone to learn about them ([if](09-light-DO.md) they are welcoming). 

But on the flip side, places like [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com) are where I can find all those small press game I love. Where else can you find a collection of dozens of Fiasco playsets?

Good luck finding a copy of [Good Society](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/good-society/), a Jane Austen regency-era rpg, at your local friendly local game store. For that I wait for the [Indie Press Revolution](https://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/) booth at whatever con I am at.
