# Want

I really want play roleplaying games with my kid. Writing this, we are less than two months from the due date and it it all hands and paws on deck readying the house the new gremlin. I really want to be able to share roleplaying games with them. I want to be able spend time at the table with them laughing at being ridiculous and strategizing through puzzles. I am already looking into d20 bookends, [Wyrmwood tables](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrmwood/modular-gaming-table), [wood burned spellbooks](https://dragonburndesigns.com) and the whole shebang. I actually myself daydreaming about running one-shot adventures during car trips.

But man makes a plan and God laughs. My wife's father loves tennis, got her tennis lessons for years before accepting that she didn't care for the game. With my little brother my dad decided that their thing would be Matchbox cars. By age two the little guy had a one-track mind for animals.

It can work though. When I was little, my dad and my thing was comic books. He had grown up in the '60s, experiencing the full silver age glory. His favorite characters were Superman and the Silver Surfer (our collection of original run Silver Surfers is quite impressive in my humble opinion). I don't recall any serious indoctrination when I was really young. Maybe some Superman pajamas with (detachable velcro cape) and a couple of comics added to my stash when I stayed home sick. The zeitgeist of the 90's did the rest to suck me in.

(Sidebar: My mother was not a big fan of comic books, I think she saw them as too little return on entertainment/dollar. However, as she has since told me, getting me to read anything was like pulling teeth and at least comic books had some words in them so she was willing to indulge the hobby.)

I am not sure I can rely on another zeitgeist to help me out but my experience does provide a case study for possible options: keep the hobby around but not necessarily omnipresent, freely provide materials with no expectation of returns, make sure the partner (is at least partially) onboard.
