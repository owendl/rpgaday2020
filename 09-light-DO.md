# Light

In an old television program, Kevin Smith was discussing comic shops but what he said I think could apply to game shops and maybe gamers in general. 

Paraphrasing because I couldn't find the clip: *"That is the reason that comic shops are dark, uninviting with iffy customer service. We don't want outsiders coming in looking around and making fun of what we love."*

After going to more than a few gaming conventions in the past few years, it does look to me like the hobby is aging. If we don't work to make our games more inviting and diverse (pick any dimension, I ain't picky) the the hobby will stay in a dark little corner away from the light.

I do think there are groups that are working towards this end, Indie Games Explosion being at the forefront in my mind but we all need to do more to grow the hobby.
