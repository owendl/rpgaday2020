# Push

I really love going to gaming conventions. So far I have gone to GenCon and Dreamation so far but I want to go to so many more. I want to try all of the games, learn all of the mechanics. I know that the hit rate won't always be great but I want to see what is out there in the hobby. Cons are beautiful for gaming "one night stands". A chance to learn a new game, have a new experience with new people.

I don't go to cons looking for comfort, I can get that easily at home, playing games I know with people I know. I want to go to push myself, to new systems, new characters, new ways to run a game. And playing with a group of strangers is so freeing. I don't need to worry about seeing them again, about looking a fool, about revealing too much because in a few days I will be on a plane and gone. 

So my advice: go to cons, play everything you can get your hands on and play your character like you stole it.
