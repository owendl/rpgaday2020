# Humor

Let's have a little fun today, with some of my favorite pieces of roleplaying humor. 

## Order of the Stick (webcomic)

[Order of the Stick](https://www.giantitp.com/index.html) is a long running webcomic that starts as a send up of characters in roleplaying games and builds tremendous heart from there. All of the characters are classic adventuring party classes, with just enough meta-commentary to keep it interesting. Also, the halfling ranger is a homicidal sociopath.

Admittedly, this is a bad example since it comes over 400 strips in, but I still smile when I think about it.

## Gamers (film series)

I made a reference to another to these films in another post but any roleplayer simply must watch these movies. The first is the weakest of the three and does not connect with the following two so feel free to skip it. The others, Gamers 2: Dorkness Rising and Gamers 3: Hands of Fate are both fully-fledged and super fun films. Both are available on Amazon Prime or on the creator's Youtube page(link straight to the playlist https://youtu.be/3buuXcHOBkI).
