For a long time I considered mystery games the unsolvable riddles in roleplaying games. How to deal with a coherent mystery without railroading the players? How do I get the players to talk to this guy to learn this thing?

It took me a little bit of practice to get used to this but my philosophy is to let go. Know who the culprit is and know what kind of clues you want to reveal but don't wed yourself to any particular source for the clues. If the players want to go to a local mechanic, that person will know something whether I knew that person existed before the game or not. It can be a little scary but what fun thing isn't?

If you want a little more help, a system built to help you tell a mystery story, I hear good things about [Gumshoe](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/gumshoe/) and [Inspectres](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17891/InSpectres) Personally, I really want to try [Bubblegumshoe](https://www.evilhat.com/home/bubblegumshoe/), which is geared towards teenage sleuthing stories.
