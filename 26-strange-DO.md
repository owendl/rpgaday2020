# Strange

This one will take a little while to get there but here we go:

The game I am most proud of as a gamemaster is the Spirit of the Century game I ran from 2012-2015. It was the game I was probably always meant to run, pulp adventure with two-fisted, swashbuckling heroes out to save the world. It is hard to describe the glow the game still gives me. 

The highwater mark of that game was July 4th weekend 2013. The group had gone up to a family cabin in Highlands, NC for a weekend of roleplaying and other gaming. That weekend I actually ran two Spirit of the Century games on back to back days for a group of 8 players. The rhythm was solid, players were invested, action was snappy and kept moving. I had to with 8 players! I tried to give everyone a bit of a moment to be cool but the one that stands out to me the most was for Max Strange, played by Bobby Brewer. 

Max was kind of a psychic-Batman with a sword. At the end of the game, in an epilogue scene I focused on a mook that had escaped out into some nearby woods. I distinctly remember acting the scene because I was just looking down at the table and breathing heavily, playing as the mook. Inside my heart was pounding, hoping that Bobby would read my mind and take the opportunity for final cool moment. And even though I didn't so much as look at him, Bobby didn't disappoint. I don't even remember what he said but without a sign from me that he knew is a beautiful moment for me.

I know hearing other people's gaming stories can be hard to listen to, lord knows I have glazed over at some stories told to me. But the emotion behind them is so strong, I can't fault anyone for wanting to share them.
