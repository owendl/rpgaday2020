My first thoughts of beginning with RPGs naturally migrates to 9th grade. I had recently moved back to Niceville, FL (yes it it nice) after being away for a few years. It was familiar but not since I was just starting high school, those last four years before I was nominally a full adult (except for that last holdout of rights, renting a car). I had chosen my seat in World History Honors to be near someone I remembered from my previous stop in town. But the conversation that piqued my ears came from another couple of boys seated nearby. 

I don't remember exactly what they were discussing at the time but in hindsight I know they were talking about their Dungeon and Dragons game. The two were Andrew Kohut and Andrew Dooley, known to everyone as Kohut and Dooley (they were from a cohort of kids that attended the same primary and middle schools with another Andrew Franco, so everyone got used to the last name convention). I remember Kohut had your classic dual wielding fighter/wizard, which in Advanced Dugeons and Dragons must have been quite a feat. Kohut moved away that year but Dooley became arguably my best friend in high school, gaming together every Saturday, gabbing about comics throughout the week.

But in thinking of that beginning my mind wanders back to an afternoon in elementary school with Daniel Plum. Again through the vagaries of memory I don't know for certain what we had a hold of but it must have been Heroquest, Milton Bradley's answer to D&D in a box. We started playing it as a standard board game but at some point it turned into a mini larp with Daniel taking the role of the monsters and me and his little brother as heroes.

But then this takes my mind to a recent conversation I had with my mother. My wife and I are about to start a new begining of parenthood and as such we are facing the final boss of the non-child-having tier: the baby shower. My wife has a penchant for "creative" toys and populated our baby registry with such. I was texting with my mom about them and asked facetiously if my collection of "little men" (what she called action figures) qualified as creative toys.

Her response verbatim:

```
Yes, you would mix them up in one game and do the talking for all of them on car trips.
```
```
You used them creatively. You did not just use one set and play with them per background story.
```
```
Makes perfect sense that you enjoy RPG as an adult.
```

So maybe there isn't really a begining to RPGs, only an ending (in the future).
